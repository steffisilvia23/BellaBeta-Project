# BellaBeta-Project
This project analyzes the Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset to gain insights into daily activity, sleep patterns, and weight logs. Using R and R Markdown in Kaggle, I performed data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to identify relationships between physical activity, sleep quality, and overall health indicators.
