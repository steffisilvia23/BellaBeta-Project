# Bella Beta – Fitbit Data Portfolio Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset to gain insights into daily activity, sleep patterns, and weight logs. Using **R and R Markdown** in Kaggle, data cleaning, exploration, and visualization were performed to identify relationships between physical activity, sleep quality, and overall health indicators.

---

## 🗂 Dataset
The project uses the **Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset** available on Kaggle, which includes:  
- `dailyActivity_merged.csv` – daily steps, calories, and distance data  
- `sleepDay_merged.csv` – sleep duration and quality information  
- `weightLogInfo_merged.csv` – user weight logs  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Loading** – Reading CSV files in R from Kaggle input paths.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, correcting data types, and formatting date columns.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Summarizing data, checking distributions, and identifying trends.  
4. **Visualization** – Creating plots for steps vs calories, sleep patterns, weight changes, and correlations.  
5. **Insights Extraction** – Identifying user lifestyle patterns and relationships between activity, sleep, and weight.

## 📈 Key Visualizations
- Daily steps vs calories burned  
- Sleep duration distribution  
- Correlation between physical activity and sleep quality  
- Weight trends over time  

---

## 📝 Conclusion
The analysis highlights patterns in physical activity, sleep, and weight that can help in understanding user health behavior. This project demonstrates practical **data analysis skills**, **R programming**, **data visualization**, and **data storytelling** using R Markdown.

## 📂 How to Run
1. Open the R Markdown file (`.Rmd`) in **Kaggle Notebook** or **RStudio**.  
2. Make sure the Fitbit dataset is added under `/kaggle/input/`.  
3. Run all code chunks to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
